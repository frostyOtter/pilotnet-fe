# About PilotNet Project

## Our Mission

PilotNet is an innovative project aimed at advancing autonomous driving technology through deep learning. Our goal is to develop robust, efficient, and safe self-driving systems that can navigate complex road conditions.

## The Team

- **Jane Doe** - Lead AI Researcher
- **John Smith** - Senior Software Engineer
- **Emily Johnson** - Data Scientist
- **Michael Brown** - Robotics Expert

## Our Approach

We utilize state-of-the-art neural network architectures to process visual input from cameras and other sensors. Our models are trained on diverse datasets to ensure performance across various driving scenarios.

## Key Features

1. Real-time image processing
2. End-to-end learning from images to steering commands
3. Adaptability to different weather and lighting conditions
4. Continuous improvement through iterative training

## Get Involved

We're always looking for passionate individuals to contribute to our project. Whether you're a machine learning expert, a robotics enthusiast, or a software developer, there's a place for you in our team.
